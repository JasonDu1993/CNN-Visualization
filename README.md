# Visualization of Deep Covolutional Neural Networks


This repository contains implementations of visualizatin of CNN in recent papers:

- [Class Activation Mapping (CAM)](https://github.com/conan7882/CNN-Visualization/tree/master/class_activation_map)

## Class Activation Mapping (CAM)
- The class activation map highlights the most informative image regions relevant to the predicted class. This map can be obtained by adding a global average pooling layer at the end of convolutional layers.

- Details of the implementation and more results are [here](https://github.com/conan7882/CNN-Visualization/tree/master/class_activation_map). Some results:
